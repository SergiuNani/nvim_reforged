1. I want a shortcut to search a word inside the current doc


Replate.txt - replace ` to "
Format.html - format the damn html
Functions.js - z0 - save -  extend one - save - it folds back 


Shityfold.js - fucking if pressing za - folding the current fold if there is somewhere  a "else if" it musnt be folded



Ctrl+Backspace - try to delete the word



When i get over an element it will be nice if we can highlight all the fucking similar words dont u think
